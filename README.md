# Domoticz-BatteryLevels

This is the very first version from my attempt to monitor the battery levels of ALL devices in Domoticz. There is a Domoticz Python Plugin to monitor battery levels of ZWave devices and you can set the Battery Low Level is the Domoticz Setting. But there is no further log in Domoticz about battery levels in the devices.

**Please let me know your findings!!!**

## Currently supported

### Standard Domoticz devices
This plugin will scan for battery levels of the 'normal' Domoticz devices

### Zwave devices
Not yet. I am not on the latest beta version of Domoticz, because of the problems with the latest Open Zwave interface.

### Philips Hue
This plugin will monitor the batterylevel of the sensors from eg. the Hue Dimmer Switch (even the Philips Hue app does not show you this battery level).
